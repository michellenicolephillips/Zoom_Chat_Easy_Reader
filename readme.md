# Zoom Chat Easy Reader

[Demo Website](https://zoom-chat-easy-reader.netlify.app/) 

[Crowd funding site](https://www.gofundme.com/f/public-zoom-chat-formatter) 

Zoom chats are hard to read. We will create an website where you can paste in your zoom chat and choose form several different formats:

- Remove time stamps
- Group by Name
- Remove Names
- Remove all formatting (stream of consciousness)
- Pretty HTML
- Add Markdown
- Hide Messages

You will be able to toggle on and off each feature and in combinations. You will then be able to save a file or cut and past the results.
