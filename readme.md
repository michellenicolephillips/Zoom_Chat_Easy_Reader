# Zoom Chat Formatter

Zoom chats are hard to read. We will create an website where you can paste in your zoom chat and choose form several different formats:

- Links Only
- Remove time stamps
- Group by Name
- Remove Names
- Remove all formatting (stream of consciousness)
- Pretty HTML
- Data in JSON format
- More as requested

You will be able to toggle on and off each feature and in combinations. You will then be able to save a file or cut and past the results.
